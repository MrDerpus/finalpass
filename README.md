<br><br>

# Setup and install as system wide command:
```sh
chmod +x setup-install.sh
./setup.sh
```
<br>

# Commands:
1. add:
```sh
# Add service with all parameters.
finalpass add service=facebook email=fake@email.com username=user-name
```

You must pass at least one argument for that entry to be saved, and the password to be generated.<br> 
The password is auto generated and encrypted with ***AES256*** before it is stored in the database.<br><br>
The database is also set with a sha512 hash of the users desired password. 
The database password is never stored in the database.

<br><br>
2. List:
```sh
finalpass list
```

This will list saved services in the database.

<br><br>
3. select:
```sh
# Select password associated with service.
# The password is decrypted and sent to the users clipboard for 10 seconds,
# then the clipboard is cleared.
finalpass select password service=facebook

# Select email associated with service.
finalpass select email service=facebook

# Select username associated with service.
finalpass select username service=facebook
```

<br><br>
4. remove:
```sh
# Remove entire entry associated with given service name.
finalpass remove service=facebook
```

<br><br>
5. change:
```sh
# Change any item in database table associated with given parameters.
# Change service name.
finalpass change service service=facebook twitter

# Change email address for defined service.
finalpass change email service=twitter new_email@email.com

# Change username for defined service
finalpass change username service=twitter new_username

# Auto generate and encrypt a new password for service.
